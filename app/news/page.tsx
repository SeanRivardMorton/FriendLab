This is a a project about bringing people together. It doesn't really work right now, and I'm sure it will look very different in the future. I have big dreams for what it might become.

If you want to help out, just shoot me a message at sean@friendlab.co.uk about why you want to help and what you think you can bring to Friend Lab.

Cheers,

Sean`,

How's it going?

I've been working on Friend Lab a bit more, and I've got some new features to show you.

You can now authenticate with Google, and you can now share your invite link with friends and family. They will appear in your friends list.

Adding people to groups is coming soon.

Then, scheduling events.

Then, iterate iterate iterate.
